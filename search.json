    "text": "The NBA playoffs are approaching. Ring culture in the NBA has changed the way fans and players look at the game. “72-10 don’t mean a thing without the ring,” is the famous Bulls slogan players wore after they set the record for regular-season wins in 1996. Close your eyes and picture the NBA finals. If you are younger you may think of Kyrie’s shot over Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett screaming ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, or Kobe finally winning a ring without Shaq. What makes a good team great? What players add to winning at the highest level?\nBPM, developed by Daniel Meyers, aims to score how impactful a player is to the team’s success. Basketball Reference states that a 6th-man level player has an average BPM of 0 and a good starter is 2.0. Usage percentage equates to how many possessions in a game ends due to the player. A field goal attempt, turnover, and free throw attempt all affect the usage rate.\nWhen the lights get brighter, players who increase their output and performance impact the team’s winning the most. The NBA’s leader for BPM in the playoffs is Michael Jordan followed by Nikola Jokic and LeBron James.These players have above an 8 BPM showcasing their career long greatness.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nmodernera &lt;-read_csv(\"nba_player_advanced_2001_2024 (1).csv\") |&gt; filter(Season &gt;2002) \npostmodern &lt;-read_csv(\"nba_player_advanced_postseason_2001_2024 (1).csv\") |&gt; filter(Season &gt;2002) \n\nreg01&lt;- modernera |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    regsumbpm = mean(BPM),\n    totalminutes = sum(MP),\n    usage = mean(`USG%`)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter( totalminutes &gt; 1500)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(regsumbpm))\n\n\npost01&lt;- postmodern |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    postsumbpm = mean(BPM),\n    totalminutes = sum(MP),\n    usage = mean(`USG%`)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter( totalminutes &gt; 1500) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(postsumbpm))\n\nFinalMerged &lt;- reg01 |&gt;  inner_join(post01, by = \"Player\")\n\nbpmdiff &lt;- FinalMerged |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    differential = postsumbpm - regsumbpm,\n  ) |&gt; \narrange(desc(differential))\n\nusagediff &lt;- FinalMerged |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    differential = usage.y - usage.x,\n  ) |&gt; \narrange(desc(differential))\n\nbpmusage &lt;- FinalMerged |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    differential = postsumbpm - regsumbpm,\n    usagediff = usage.y - usage.x\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(usage.x &gt; 15) |&gt; \n  filter(usagediff &gt; -1) |&gt;\n  filter(totalminutes.y &gt; 2000) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(differential))\n\ntopten &lt;- bpmusage |&gt; \n  filter(usage.x &gt; 15) |&gt; \n  filter(usagediff &gt; -1) |&gt;\n  filter(differential &gt; 0) |&gt; \n  filter(totalminutes.y &gt; 2000) |&gt; \ntop_n(10,differential) \n\n\nchampions &lt;- topten |&gt; \n  filter(Player%in%c(\"LeBron James\", \"Rajon Rondo\", \"Boris Diaw\",\"Draymond Green\", \"Danny Green\", \"Jamal Murray\",\"Derrick White\",\"Kobe Bryant\"))\n\nworst&lt;- bpmusage |&gt; \n  filter(Player%in%c(\"Udonis Haslem\", \"CJ McCollum\", \"Bam Adebayo\"))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=bpmusage, aes(x=differential, y=usagediff),color=\"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=topten, aes(x=differential, y=usagediff),colour = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=champions, aes(x=differential, y=usagediff),colour = \"gold\") +\ngeom_point(data=worst, aes(x=differential, y=usagediff),colour = \"#964B00\")+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=topten, \n    aes(x=differential, y=usagediff, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=worst, \n    aes(x=differential, y=usagediff, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1.5, y=4, label=\"Higher Usage, Better Production\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=-2, y=2, label=\"Higher Usage, Worse Production\"), color=\"blue\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = 0,color=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\" Impact on the Game\",\n    y=\"Usage Difference from Playoffs to Regular Season\", \n    title=\"What Players Increase Their Output in the Playoffs?\", \n    subtitle=\"The players who have seen the biggest production increase from the regular season to the post season\\nhave resulted in deep playoff runs. \", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Nolan Rachiele\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 10 best players whose differential from the playoffs to the regular season is higher include Josh Smith, Rajon Rondo, Derrick White, Danny Green, and Draymond Green. All of them have a differential greater than 2.0 meaning their postseason output is a starter-level player better than their regular season play. Eight out of the ten most impactful playoff players have rings.\nSome of those players were their teams first option. LeBron James and Kobe Bryant each had a usage rate playoff usage rate higher than 25 percent for their entire career. However, most came as the second, third, or even fourth fiddle to bigger offensive stars.\n\n\nCode\noffense &lt;- read_csv(\"NETRATINGONOFFPOSTOFFENSE.csv\")\ndefense&lt;- read_csv(\"NETRATINGONOFF.csv\")\n\nnewd&lt;- defense |&gt; \n  rename(\n    Player = 1,\n    MinutesOn = 2,\n    MinutesOff = 3,\n    PTSon = 4,\n    PTSoff = 5,\n    DefNTR = 6\n  )\n\no&lt;- offense |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \nsummarise(\n  Min = sum(`Minutes On`),\n  MinOff = sum(`Minutes Off`),\n  ONet = mean(`Offensive Net Rating`)\n)\n\n\nd &lt;- newd |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \nsummarise(\n  DMin = sum(MinutesOn),\n  DMinOff = sum(MinutesOff),\n  DefNet = mean(DefNTR))\n\njoinedrating &lt;- o |&gt;  inner_join(d)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=joinedrating, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, ONet), x=ONet, xend=DefNet),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"#006400\",\n    colour_xend = \"#FF4D00\")+\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 0,color=\"#4169e1\")+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Net Rating Differential\",\n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Winning Means Impacting Both Sides of the Court\", \n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style = 'color:#006400;'&gt;offensive net rating&lt;/span&gt; is to the right of the &lt;span style = 'color:#4169e1;'&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; the player adds points to their teams offense.

The team’s net rating uses the same formula but is calculated by the team’s numbers while the player is off the court.\nOut of the 28 players who have a higher differential in post-season usage and post-season BPM, 16 have championships.\nJamal Murray has the largest Offensive net rating compared to his team. On the road to Denver’s recent playoff success, they score 13 more points with him on the court compared to off. But, his team allows 3.8 more points with him on the court. The highest differential is awarded to Draymond Green who is a plus 7.4 on offense and allows 5 fewer points on defense.\n\n\nCode\nallreg_seasons&lt;- read_csv(\"allreg_seasons.csv\")\nallpost_seasons &lt;-read_csv(\"allpost_seasons.csv\")\n\npostseason&lt;- allpost_seasons |&gt; \n   group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  select(Player, MIN, Diff, `Exp W`) |&gt; \nmutate(postseasondiff = Diff)\n\n\nregseason &lt;- allreg_seasons |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  select(Player, MIN, Diff, `Exp W`) |&gt; \nmutate(regseasondiff = Diff)\n\ngroupedreg &lt;- regseason |&gt; \n  group_by(Player ) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    minutes = sum(MIN),\n    Expected = mean(`Exp W`),\n    careerdifferential = mean(Diff), )\n\nnewpost &lt;- postseason |&gt; \n  rename(\n   PostMin = MIN,\n   PostDiff = Diff,\n   PostExpW = `Exp W`)\n   \ngroupedpost &lt;- newpost |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    Postseasonminutes= sum(PostMin),\n    Expectedwin = mean(PostExpW),\n    postseasondiff = mean(postseasondiff)) \ncleaningglass &lt;- groupedpost|&gt; inner_join(groupedreg, by = \"Player\")\n\nwinsadded &lt;- cleaningglass |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    wintotal = Expectedwin - Expected,\n    addedpoints = postseasondiff - careerdifferential)\n\n top10 &lt;- filter(winsadded, Player %in% c(\"Rajon Rondo\",\"Danny Green\",\"Draymond Green\",\"Jamal Murray\",\"Boris Diaw\",\"Kobe Bryant\",\"Lebron James\",\"Dirk Nowitzki\",\"Nikola Jokic\",\"Khris Middleton\",\"Dwayne Wade\",\"Anthony Davis\",\"Serge Ibaka\",\"Jayson Tatum\",\"Stephen Curry\",\"Lamar Odom\",\"Andre Iguodala\",\"Giannis Antetokounmpo\"))\nchamp &lt;- top10 |&gt; filter(Player %in% c(\"Draymond Green\",\"Stephen Curry\",\"Kobe Bryant\",\"Danny Green\",\"Dirk Nowitzki\",\"Lamar Odom\",\"Andre Iguodala\"))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top10, aes(x=reorder(Player, Expectedwin), weight=Expectedwin),fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=champ, aes(x=reorder(Player, Expectedwin), weight=Expectedwin), fill=\"#AA8833\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1.001567398,color=\"#E11218\",size=1.4) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Expected Wins Added\", \n    title=\"How do players net rating affect their playoff wins?\", \n    subtitle=\"The career wins added for each champion players playoff career.
