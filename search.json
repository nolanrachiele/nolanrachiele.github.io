    "text": "The NBA playoffs are approaching. Ring culture in the NBA has changed the way fans and players look at the game. “72-10 don’t mean a thing without the ring” is the famous Bulls slogan players wore after they set the record for regular-season wins in 1996. Close your eyes and picture the NBA Finals. If you are younger, you may think of Kyrie’s shot over Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett screaming ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, or Kobe finally winning a ring without Shaq. What makes a good team great? What players add to winning at the highest level?\nBPM, developed by Daniel Myers, aims to score how impactful a player is to the team’s success. Basketball Reference states that a 6th-man-level player has an average BPM of 0, and a good starter is 2.0. Usage percentage equates to how many possessions in a game end due to the player. A field goal attempt, turnover, and free throw attempt all affect the usage rate.\nWhen the lights get brighter, players who increase their output and performance impact the team’s winning the most. The NBA’s leader for BPM in the playoffs is Michael Jordan, followed by Nikola Jokić and LeBron James. These players have above an 8 BPM, showcasing their career-long greatness.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nmodernera &lt;-read_csv(\"nba_player_advanced_2001_2024 (1).csv\") |&gt; filter(Season &gt;2002) \npostmodern &lt;-read_csv(\"nba_player_advanced_postseason_2001_2024 (1).csv\") |&gt; filter(Season &gt;2002) \n\nreg01&lt;- modernera |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    regsumbpm = mean(BPM),\n    totalminutes = sum(MP),\n    usage = mean(`USG%`)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter( totalminutes &gt; 1500)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(regsumbpm))\n\n\npost01&lt;- postmodern |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    postsumbpm = mean(BPM),\n    totalminutes = sum(MP),\n    usage = mean(`USG%`)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter( totalminutes &gt; 1500) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(postsumbpm))\n\nFinalMerged &lt;- reg01 |&gt;  inner_join(post01, by = \"Player\")\n\nbpmdiff &lt;- FinalMerged |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    differential = postsumbpm - regsumbpm,\n  ) |&gt; \narrange(desc(differential))\n\nusagediff &lt;- FinalMerged |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    differential = usage.y - usage.x,\n  ) |&gt; \narrange(desc(differential))\n\nbpmusage &lt;- FinalMerged |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    differential = postsumbpm - regsumbpm,\n    usagediff = usage.y - usage.x\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(usage.x &gt; 15) |&gt; \n  filter(usagediff &gt; -1) |&gt;\n  filter(totalminutes.y &gt; 2000) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(differential))\n\ntopten &lt;- bpmusage |&gt; \n  filter(usage.x &gt; 15) |&gt; \n  filter(usagediff &gt; -1) |&gt;\n  filter(differential &gt; 0) |&gt; \n  filter(totalminutes.y &gt; 2000) |&gt; \ntop_n(10,differential) \n\n\nchampions &lt;- topten |&gt; \n  filter(Player%in%c(\"LeBron James\", \"Rajon Rondo\", \"Boris Diaw\",\"Draymond Green\", \"Danny Green\", \"Jamal Murray\",\"Derrick White\",\"Kobe Bryant\"))\n\nworst&lt;- bpmusage |&gt; \n  filter(Player%in%c(\"Udonis Haslem\", \"CJ McCollum\", \"Bam Adebayo\"))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=bpmusage, aes(x=differential, y=usagediff),color=\"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=topten, aes(x=differential, y=usagediff),colour = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=champions, aes(x=differential, y=usagediff),colour = \"gold\") +\ngeom_point(data=worst, aes(x=differential, y=usagediff),colour = \"#964B00\")+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=topten, \n    aes(x=differential, y=usagediff, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=worst, \n    aes(x=differential, y=usagediff, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1.5, y=4, label=\"Higher Usage, Better Production\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=-2, y=2, label=\"Higher Usage, Worse Production\"), color=\"blue\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = 0,color=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\" Impact on the Game\",\n    y=\"Usage Difference from Playoffs to Regular Season\", \n    title=\"What Players Increase Their Output in the Playoffs?\", \n    subtitle=\"The players who have seen the biggest production increase from the regular season to the post season\\nhave resulted in deep playoff runs. \", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Nolan Rachiele\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 10 best players whose BPM differential from the regular season to the playoffs is the highest include Josh Smith, Rajon Rondo, Derrick White, Danny Green, and Draymond Green.

Eight out of the ten most impactful playoff players have won rings.\nSome of these players were their team’s first option.

A team’s net rating uses the same formula but is based on team performance while the player is off the court.\nAmong the 28 players who show an increase in both postseason usage and postseason BPM, 16 have won championships—highlighting the link between elevated playoff performance and team success.\nJamal Murray has the highest offensive net rating differential compared to his team. During Denver’s recent playoff run, the Nuggets scored 13 more points per 100 possessions with him on the court versus when he sat. However, they also allowed 3.8 more points on defense during those minutes.\nThe highest overall net rating differential belongs to Draymond Green. With him on the court, his team is +7.4 offensively and allows 5 fewer points per 100 possessions defensively—a testament to his two-way impact.\n\n\nCode\nallreg_seasons&lt;- read_csv(\"allreg_seasons.csv\")\nallpost_seasons &lt;-read_csv(\"allpost_seasons.csv\")\n\npostseason&lt;- allpost_seasons |&gt; \n   group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  select(Player, MIN, Diff, `Exp W`) |&gt; \nmutate(postseasondiff = Diff)\n\n\nregseason &lt;- allreg_seasons |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  select(Player, MIN, Diff, `Exp W`) |&gt; \nmutate(regseasondiff = Diff)\n\ngroupedreg &lt;- regseason |&gt; \n  group_by(Player ) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    minutes = sum(MIN),\n    Expected = mean(`Exp W`),\n    careerdifferential = mean(Diff), )\n\nnewpost &lt;- postseason |&gt; \n  rename(\n   PostMin = MIN,\n   PostDiff = Diff,\n   PostExpW = `Exp W`)\n   \ngroupedpost &lt;- newpost |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    Postseasonminutes= sum(PostMin),\n    Expectedwin = mean(PostExpW),\n    postseasondiff = mean(postseasondiff)) \ncleaningglass &lt;- groupedpost|&gt; inner_join(groupedreg, by = \"Player\")\n\nwinsadded &lt;- cleaningglass |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    wintotal = Expectedwin - Expected,\n    addedpoints = postseasondiff - careerdifferential)\n\n top10 &lt;- filter(winsadded, Player %in% c(\"Rajon Rondo\",\"Danny Green\",\"Draymond Green\",\"Jamal Murray\",\"Boris Diaw\",\"Kobe Bryant\",\"Lebron James\",\"Dirk Nowitzki\",\"Nikola Jokic\",\"Khris Middleton\",\"Dwayne Wade\",\"Anthony Davis\",\"Serge Ibaka\",\"Jayson Tatum\",\"Stephen Curry\",\"Lamar Odom\",\"Andre Iguodala\",\"Giannis Antetokounmpo\"))\nchamp &lt;- top10 |&gt; filter(Player %in% c(\"Draymond Green\",\"Stephen Curry\",\"Kobe Bryant\",\"Danny Green\",\"Dirk Nowitzki\",\"Lamar Odom\",\"Andre Iguodala\"))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top10, aes(x=reorder(Player, Expectedwin), weight=Expectedwin),fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=champ, aes(x=reorder(Player, Expectedwin), weight=Expectedwin), fill=\"#AA8833\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1.001567398,color=\"#E11218\",size=1.4) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Expected Wins Added\", \n    title=\"How do players net rating affect their playoff wins?\", \n    subtitle=\"The career wins added for each champion players playoff career.
